		This project is a <b>Trie Data Structure</b> implementation in Java. The trie data-structure extends the <code>Map</code> abstract class. 
		This is because the data-structure is viewed as a dictionary where the string is looked up and some data associated with the string 
		is returned. But this implementation is not restricted to only strings of ASCII characters or even characters at all. Rather, this 
		implementation can be a string of any object which extends the <code>TrieCharacter</code> abstract class. The purpose for this abstract class is 
		so that the two methods used for comparison of any two objects, <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> must be defined by the developer according to 
		her/his requirements. The strings can be sequence of actual alphabet objects or numeric objects or paths to name a few use cases.
